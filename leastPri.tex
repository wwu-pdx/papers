\subsection{cloud and its complexity}
Advantages bestowed by cloud technologies, such as efficiency, agility, scalability and cost savings, are crucial for business success in todayâ€™s market. According to the 2020 Flexera State of the Cloud Report \cite{Flexera2020}, enterprises are running 48\% of their workloads and storing 45\% of their data in public clouds and planning to increase workload and data-related cloud utilization by 9\% and 8\% respectively over the next 12 months. This trend will continue to grow.

As defined by The US National Institute of Standards and Technology \cite{NIST2016},
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

Clouds allow organizations to reduce startup costs and maintenance tasks in infrastructure (hardware and network) layers through virtualization. However, integration, both between cloud services and legacy systems and between various services from different cloud resources and platforms, is quite complex \cite{Baron2019}. 
The findings in the same Flexera report \cite{Flexera2020} indicate that 93\% of enterprises are embracing multi-cloud solutions (involving multiple public and/or private clouds), among which 87\% are taking a hybrid approach. Services from different platforms that are not always compatible with each other can pose data interoperability and ownership issues.
The rapid adoption of technologies such as containers and serverless frameworks also contributes to cloud complexity. In the State of DevSecOps report \cite{Sharrm} , containers are being used by 84\% of the organizations surveyed and 41\% are using serverless frameworks.

Identity and access control management(IAM) becomes a more complex problem in the cloud as a result of resource extensibility and diversity compared to legacy IT environments. The requirements to understand and configure effective access for different applications, services and platforms exacerbate the problem.



\subsection{Cloud Security}
Complexities mentioned above, along with the Unique architectural features, raise various security and privacy concerns \cite{Takabi2010}. A Study \cite{Ermetic2020} commissioned by Ermetic, IDC revealed that nearly 80\% of companies experienced at least one cloud data breach during 2019 and the first half of 2020 .and that the top three cloud security threats are misconfiguration of production environments (67 \%), lack of visibility into access in production environments (64 \%) and improper IAM and permission configurations (61\%). According to IBM's Cost of Data Breach Report 2020 \cite{IBMSecurity2020}, misconfigurations were exploited in 19\% of malicious breaches with a cost of \$4.41 million . This number is 14\% higher than the average cost of data breach.
