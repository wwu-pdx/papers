@phdthesis{Sanders2018,
abstract = {The Principle of Least Privilege is a security objective of granting users only those accesses they need to perform their duties. Creating least privilege policies in the cloud environment with many diverse services, each with unique privilege sets, is significantly more challenging than policy creation previously studied in other environments. Such security policies are always imperfect and must balance between the security risk of granting over-privilege and the effort to correct for under-privilege. In this paper, we formally define the problem of balancing between over-privilege and under-privilege as the Privilege Error Minimization Problem (PEMP) and present a method for quantitatively scoring security policies. We design and compare three algorithms for automatically generating policies: a naive algorithm, an unsupervised learning algorithm, and a supervised learning algorithm. We present the results of evaluating these three policy generation algorithms on a real-world dataset consisting of 5.2 million Amazon Web Service (AWS) audit log entries. The application of these methods can help create policies that balance between an organization's acceptable level of risk and effort to correct under-privilege.},

abstract = {The design of mechanisms to control the sharing of information in the Multics system is described. Five design principles help provide insight into the tradeoffs among different possible designs. The key mechanisms described include access control lists, hierarchical control of access specifications, identification and authentication of users, and primary memory protection. The paper ends with a discussion of several known weaknesses in the current protection mechanism design. {\textcopyright} 1974, ACM. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics (On-demand self-service, Broad network access, Resource pooling, Rapid elasticity, Measured Service); three service models (Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS), Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS), Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)); and, four deployment models (Private cloud, Community cloud, Public cloud, Hybrid cloud). Key enabling technologies include: (1) fast wide-area networks, (2) powerful, inexpensive server computers, and (3) high-performance virtualization for commodity hardware.},

abstract = {In January 2016, RightScale surveyed 1,060 technical professionals across a broad cross-section of organizations about their adoption of cloud computing. The company published its annual State of the Cloud Report on February 9, 2016. We also asked a number of additional questions about their adoption of DevOps and use of DevOps tools, including Docker. In this DevOps Trends report, we offer a deep dive into those responses as well as some additional analysis about DevOps. The 2016 State of the Cloud Survey identified several key findings: DevOps growing especially in the enterprise. • DevOps adoption increased from 66 percent in 2015 to 74 percent in 2016. • DevOps adoption is strongest in the enterprise (81 percent of enterprises adopting DevOps compared to 70 percent in SMBs). • Enterprises are adopting DevOps from the bottom up: projects or teams (29 percent) and business units or divisions (31 percent), company-wide (21 percent).

abstract = {The Cloud Security Alliance is a not-for-profit organization with a mission to widely promote best practices for ensuring cyber security in cloud computing and IT technologies. CSA is also tasked with educating various stakeholders within these industries about security concerns in all other forms of computing. CSA's membership is comprised of a broad coalition of industry practitioners, corporations, and professional associations. One of CSA's primary goals is to conduct surveys that assess information security trends. These surveys help gauge the maturity of information security technology at various points in the industry, as well as the rate of adoption of security best practices. AlgoSec, a leading network security solution provider, commissioned CSA to develop a survey to add to the industry's knowledge about hybrid-cloud and multi-cloud security, and to prepare this report of the survey's findings. Algosec financed the project and co-developed the initiative by participating with CSA in the development of survey questions addressing hybrid cloud security. The survey was conducted online by CSA, from December 2018 to February 2019, and was submitted to nearly 700 IT and security professionals from a variety of organization sizes and locations. Approximately 500 organizations answered the majority of the 20-question survey. The data analysis here was performed by CSA's research team.},
