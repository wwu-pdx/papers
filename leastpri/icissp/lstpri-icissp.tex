\abstract
{As more businesses migrate their workloads into cloud environments, the importance of following the principle of least privilege (PoLP) to mitigate security risks significantly increases. Unfortunately, the infrastructure being utilized and the mechanism for doing securing it in the cloud is complex and substantially
different than traditional legacy infrastructure.  As a result, the amount of practitioners that know how to secure cloud projects is insufficient compared
to the number of cloud projects being created.  To address this, this paper describes a Least Privilege CTF, a series of Google Cloud based exercises that can be quickly deployed at minimal cost, to allow players to practice applying PoLP in cloud deployments.
