\abstract
{As more businesses integrating into the cloud environment, the importance of following the principle of least privilege (PoLP) to mitigate security risks significantly increases. The fact that both identity and access management (IAM) and infrastructure itself in cloud environments are sophisticated, and the lack of CTF (Capture-the-Flag) exercises pivot around IAM best practices make the task of understanding the concepts and following PoLP onerous. This paper describes Least Privilege CTF, a series of Google Cloud based labs that can be quickly deployed at minimal cost, to assist comprehension and illustrate the process of implementing PoLP.
